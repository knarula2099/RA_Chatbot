STAFF EXPECTATIONS AND POLICIES

The R/HA is expected to serve as a role model and abide by all University and Residential
Life policies. The R/HA is expected to adopt the goals of maintaining a safe, secure, and
comfortable living and learning environment. As a role model and a programmer, the
R/HA is further fulfilling the University's mission for education and service as well as
maintaining good academic standing and continuing full-time student status.

Alcohol, Marijuana, and Drugs Policy

We expect that as RAs, you will NOT participate in the following:

. Consumption of alcohol if you are not of legal age.
. Attendance at gatherings on-campus where alcohol is being consumed by people
under the legal age or in a way which violates university policies or legal
regulations.
. Planning or organization of on-campus events where alcohol will be consumed
illegally.
. Promotion of any event where alcohol will be consumed or served illegally.
. Providing or serving alcohol to minors or illegal/controlled substances, in or outside

during any job function requiring unimpaired judgment.
. Returning to the residence halls intoxicated and unable to care for your personal
safety.
. Using illegal/controlled substances (on or off campus).

Failure to adhere to these expectations regarding alcohol and the use of illegal or
controlled drugs will result in corrective action including but not limited to, written
documentation or termination.

Academics

Academic success of 2.50 is the minimum for quarterly and cumulative Grade Point
Average in order to apply and at the time of hire for the RA position. If a candidate's
quarterly and/or cumulative GPA fall below a 2.50 at any point during the academic year
(including summer sessions, prior to, or at the time of hire), the candidacy may be
forfeited, and if offered a position, the offer may be rescinded. An employee whose
quarterly and/or cumulative GPA drops below the university academic minimum will be
subjected to conditional employment and/or release of employment at the discretion of
the Associate Dean of Student Affairs/Director of Residence Life staff. Quarterly grade
checks will be conducted by the Assistant Directors of Residence Life, after grades have
been finalized. If an employee is anticipating a quarterly and/or cumulative grade point
